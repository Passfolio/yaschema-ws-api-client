Web client supporting WebSockets via yaschema-ws-api

## Basic Example

```typescript
â€¦
```

The above example demonstrates compile-time, type-safe use of a yaschema-api, which also performs runtime validation.  With yaschema-api, both the client and server can use the same API definitions.  However, it's also fine for the API definitions to be used in a one-sided way, for example, when integrating with third-party REST APIs.

With yaschema-api, types can be defined for:

- request headers, params, query, and body
- success response status, headers, and body
- expected failure response status, headers, and body
